# _Apaji Mela_

With students coming from different parts of India, the 850 acre Campus Banasthali today with 16000 students itself is a mini India echoing the lines of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in National anthem “Panjaba-Sindhu-Gujarata-Maratha Dravida-Utkala-Banga.”

The evolution of Banasthali is nothing short of a fairy tale in which the parents freedom fighter and Gandhian Pt Hiralal Shastri and Padma Bhushan & Jamnalal Babaj Award winner Smt Ratan Shastri took up the mission with passion for setting up an institution at Banasthali to fulfill the desire of their beloved daughter Shantabai who died at a very young age but had sown the seeds of a school built with mud bricks made by her own hands for educating girls.

Globally, STEM disciplines have always been considered to be a male domain. Banasthali University has broken this myth long back by bringing girls to STEM education when the world was still grappling with meager enrollment of women in these fields. The unique five- fold educational ideology of Banasthali comprising of physical, practical, aesthetic, intellectual and moral aspects of education advocates an optimum blend of these components towards all-round development of students.
