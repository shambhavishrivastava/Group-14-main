<h4 className="text-center boredr-bottom text-info">Department Of Legal Studies</h4>

<p>Banasthali Vidyapith has long history of nurturing women leaders in all walks of life. Of late its IT, Management and Technology graduates have won accolades for themselves and their alma mater. In the same line, the Vidyapith has conceptualized an all women's law school to nurture legal professionals of the highest order possessing the usual strong virtues of the Vidyapith. Faculty of Law at the Banasthali Vidyapith was established in the year 2013 with the aim of imparting world class legal education to girls from various parts of the country.</p>

<p>The Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation very kindly consented to give a onetime philanthropic grant to partially meet the expenses of the Law School Building, named as Jamnalal Bajaj School of Legal Studies. The vision of legal education is to provide justice oriented education essential to the realization of values enshrined in the Constitution of India.</p>

<p>Legal education as an aspect of professional education has assumed considerable significance, not only in terms of the historical utility of law in society but also in the current context of globalization. Legal education is a vital link in the creation of knowledge concept as well as in the application of such concept in society. The need for trained law personnel in academia, litigation, corporate practice, government and civil society has increased significantly over the last few years and it is estimated that the demand for such trained personnel will rise far more exponentially in the years to come.</p>

<p>The Law School aims at preparing women legal professionals who will play decisive leadership roles, not only as advocates practicing in courts, but also as academicians, legislators, judges, policy makers, public officials, civil society activists, and legal counsels in the private sector, maintaining the highest standard of professional ethics and a spirit of public service. We are aware that legal education should also prepare professionals equipped to meet the new challenges and dimensions of internationalization, where the nature and organization of law and practice are undergoing a paradigm shift. At the same time, legal education must also be socially engaged and sensitize students to issues of social justice. New and innovative solutions are needed to ensure that common people have access to justice, and the legal ideas and legal knowledge protect their interests. Therefore, it is imperative that legal education should prepare students with the aptitude, interest, commitment, skills and knowledge necessary to work with socially excluded people and the poor at the grass-root level to advance the cause of justice.</p>

<h4 className="text-center border-bottom text-danger">Department Of Mathematics & Statistics</h4>

<p>Mathematics is the music of mind and it attracts people of finest minds in the world. It is the backbone of all sciences. If a  question arises  like which came first in human civilization  - Mathematics or Language? Certainly the answer is Mathematics. If we go back to the begining of stone-age civilization we can see that people used to count their domestic animals by using different stones, and they used body languages to express their mind.</p>

<p>If we study Vedic Mathematics then we can find that the most important number 'Zero' was discovered in India. One of the important irrational like  'Pie' was discovered by the great Indian Mathematician Aryabhatte (476 - 550 AD), who was born in Patliputra in Magadh.</p>

<p>Today there is no nobel prize in Mathematics but International Mathematical Union (IMU) offers Fields Medal once in every four years during International Congress of Mathematicians. (ICM) which is equivalant to nobel prize.</p>
